The `indexOf` method uses `index`, which doesn't exist in its scope. It should iterate through the list to find `target`. Fixing it:

The error is fixed. The linter shows only style warnings, not compilation errors.

## Explanation

The `indexOf` method was using `index`, which doesn't exist in that method's scope. The method should:
1. Iterate through the list
2. Check if each element equals the `target` parameter
3. Return the index when found, or -1 if not found

**The fix:**
- Changed the loop condition from `i < index` to `i < size`
- Added a check using the `equals` helper method to compare each node's cargo with the target
- Return the index `i` when a match is found

This follows the same pattern as the `lastIndexOf` method in your code. The method now correctly searches for the target object and returns its index.

Classify and improve `subList`:

- Classify: determine its time complexity (order of growth).
- Improve: make it more efficient.

Issues to address:
1. It iterates through the entire list even when only a portion is needed.
2. The boundary check may be incorrect: `subList(fromIndex, toIndex)` should include `fromIndex` and exclude `toIndex` (so `i < toIndex`, not `i <= toIndex`).
3. It starts from the beginning instead of jumping to `fromIndex`.

Questions to consider:
1. What is the current time complexity? (How many nodes does it visit?)
2. What should the time complexity be? (How many nodes should it visit?)
3. How can you start from `fromIndex` instead of the beginning?

Hint: You already have a helper method that can get you to a specific index efficiently. Look at your `getNode` method.

Try this:
1. Use `getNode` (or a similar approach) to start at `fromIndex`.
2. Iterate only until `toIndex` (exclusive).
3. Stop early instead of continuing through the rest of the list.

Should I provide a small scaffold with TODOs, or do you want to try it first?

Indentation fixed. The linter shows only warnings and one unreachable code error (separate issue).

## Explanation

The `removeAll` method had incorrect indentation:
- The method declaration (`public boolean removeAll...`) should be indented 4 spaces (one level inside the class).
- The method body should be indented 8 spaces (two levels: class + method).
- The closing brace should be indented 4 spaces.

The code now follows Java indentation conventions. The unreachable code after `throw new UnsupportedOperationException();` is a separate issue (that code never executes).
